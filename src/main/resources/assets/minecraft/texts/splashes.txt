Howdy, pardner!
I'm just a man...
Are you gonna pull those pistols or whistle Dixie?
Think you used enough dynamite there, Butch?
Welcome to Australia!
We can control it! Like a monkey's bladder!
Never do that again.
Those with loaded guns, and those who dig.
Sometimes the dead can be more useful than the living.
A man's got to know his limitations.
I tried being reasonable, I didn't like it
Now you know why they call me
A gun and three of a kind always beats three of a kind.
Head ‘em up, move ‘em out!
That sure puts the pig meat in the fire!
A change of pastures makes for a fatter calf.
Don’t cut in front and don’t crowd from behind.
Don’t go milking your neighbor’s cow.
